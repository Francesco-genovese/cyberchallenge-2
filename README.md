Problem Statement
Programming Test CyberChallenge.IT 2024
Bob: Prof. Alan, I think I've been infected by malware...
Alan: Fear not, dear Bob, it's not malware. It's just a CTF challenge that prints funny things on your terminal. But we can use it to delve into reverse engineering!
Charlie: Reverse engineering? What's that?
Alan: In simple terms, it's dissecting a piece of software to understand its internal workings. In Bob's case, we have a virtual machine with simple custom instructions. One of the first steps typically tackled in these challenges is creating an emulator. Do you think you're up for the challenge?
Bob starts screaming and runs away...

Initially, all 6 variables are set to 0. Operations are always performed between integer values.
